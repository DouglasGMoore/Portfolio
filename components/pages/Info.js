    Thank you for checking out my portfolio! I hope you like it. I am just beginning
      my journey as a web developer. I already have experience with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Pyhton, and C#.
      I especially love JavaScript and Python.
      I have taken classes on HTML/CSS and JavaScript from freecodecamp.org and CodeAcademy.com. I am
      currently participating in a Javascript bootcamp through Savvy Coders.
      In the future, I hope to specialiize in full-stack web developement and then graduate
      into AI and deep learning. 
      I am also gaining experience and proficiency on Linux. I have used Centos, Mint, Manjaro, and Ubuntu.</div>
