    <p>This bootcamp was help in St.Louis and was a blast. I learned with 10 other students and I really learned what it is like to develope 
    in a professional enviornment. I had a great time and I made some excellent friends. Not for everyone, but I still would recomend this to 
    someone who already knows the basics of JavaScript</p>

    </div>
    <p>Jobcyte was what I built for my Capstone Project. Jobcyte aims to be the only source for documentation that you will ever need. 
    I built it with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JavaScript frameworks, MySQL, google maps API, and my own self-made API. I am attempting to host 
    if on Heroku now, but I am having difficulties. A demonstration and explanation of my Single Page Application can be seen in the linked 
    video or in person.</p>

    </div>
    <p>This was an excellent class. It covered so much information. It was very challenging at points too. I built projects in C, then in 
    JavaScript, then in Python. Every step of the way reducing keystrokes when coding. It was an amazing experience and i would recommend it 
    to anyone.

    *I am working on integrating my CS50 projects into this portfolio. There has been some trouble with others viewing my submit50 page on 
    github with my homework and solutions on it.

    <p>freecodecamp.org was my introduction to web design and developement. From the first tribute website I was hooked. 
    The classes I took covered HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was eye opening to learn how complicated positioning can get </p>
