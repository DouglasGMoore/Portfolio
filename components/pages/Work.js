    </div>
    <p>This was an excellent class. It covered so much information. It was very challenging at points too. I built projects in C, then in JavaScript, then in Python. 
    every step of the way reducing keystrokes when coding. It was an amazing expreience and i would recomend it to anyone.

    *I am working on integrating my CS50 projects into this portfolio. There has been some trouble with others viewing my submit50 page on github with my homework and solutions on it.

    </div>
    <p>This bootcamp was help in St.Louis and was a blast. I learned with 10 other students and I really learned what it is like to develope in a 
    professional enviornment. I had a great time an d I made some excellent friends. Not for everyone, but I still would recomend this to someone 
    who already knows the basics of JavaScript</p>
